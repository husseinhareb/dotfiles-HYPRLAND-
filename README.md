This is where I keep all of the various dotfiles for different programs I use.

You are welcome to copy any of my  dotfiles or scripts you come across here. Many of them have been sourced and slightly edited from other individuals' dotfiles. However, I advise against attempting to duplicate my entire setup, as it lacks organization and is tailored to my specific requirements (Specially the hyprland config file). Instead, I encourage you to extract fragments and incorporate them into your own personalized dotfiles, creating a configuration that suits your individual needs.

The packages needed for this setup: 

    hyprland-bin kitty waybar-hyprland 
    swaybg swaylock-effects wofi wlogout dunst thunar 
    ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd noto-fonts-emoji
    polkit-gnome python-requests starship 
    swappy grim slurp pamixer brightnessctl gvfs
    bluez bluez-utils lxappearance xfce4-settings 
    dracula-gtk-theme dracula-icons-git xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland-git
